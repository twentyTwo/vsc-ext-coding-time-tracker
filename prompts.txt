I want to create a VS Code extension that tracks my coding time. 
There will be a status bar that shows the total time spent on the current project today. Hovering that bar will show a hover card with the total time spent on the current project on weekly, monthly, and all time basis.
Clicking on the status bar will open a summary view of the time I spend on each project on a daily, weekly, monthly, or custom range basis.
The status bar will show when the vs code is opened but start tracking only when the vs code is in focus a a file is opened.

It will track the time I spend on each project.
I want to see a intuitive and aesthetically pleasing summary report on the time I spend on each project on a daily, weekly, monthly, or custom range basis.
The backend database should be easy to query so I can add custom metrics like most productive days, longest coding session, etc.
The extension should be lightweight and not affect the performance of VS Code.

The backend data structure should be as follows:
Date | Project | Time Spent (in minutes)

e.g.
2024-02-20 | Project 1 | 30
2024-02-20 | Project 2 | 20
2024-02-21 | Project 1 | 40
2024-02-21 | Project 2 | 10

Store all the data locally for vscode plugins


## Features
- Real-time tracking of coding time
- Status bar display of todays total coding time across all project and on the current project.
e.g. [Icon of timer ] Today: 2h 30m | Current Project: 1h 30m
